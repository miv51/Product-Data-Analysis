    "This query returns **aggregated summaries of purchasing behavior** for specific customers, rather than individual transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in the result set represents a **unique combination of a customer, their country, and a specific product description (item)** that meets certain criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down what defines each row in the output:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Who is included?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Only identifiable customers (Customer_ID IS NOT NULL).\n",
    "    - Only customers involved in actual sales (where Quantity is positive).\n",
    "    - Only customers involved in non-canceled orders (where Invoice does NOT start with 'C').\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What constitutes a row?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Each row is a summary for a specific Customer_ID, from a particular Country, and concerning one Description (i.e., one distinct product item).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What makes them \"loyal\" for this specific product?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT c.Invoice) > 1 clause is key here. It filters the aggregated rows to only include those where the customer has purchased that particular Description (product item) on more than one distinct, non-canceled invoice. This is how the query defines \"loyal\" in this context – a customer isn't just a one-time buyer of that specific item.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What information do you get for each row?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ```Customer_ID```: The identifier of the customer.\n",
    "    - ```Country```: The country of that customer.\n",
    "    - ```Description```: The specific product item (e.g., \"WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER\", \"REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER\") that the customer has repeatedly purchased.\n",
    "    - ```TotalQuantityBoughtOfProduct```: The sum of all positive quantities of that specific product purchased by that customer across all their relevant invoices.\n",
    "    - ```NumberOfInvoicesForProduct```: The count of distinct invoices where this customer purchased that specific product. (This value will always be greater than 1 due to the ```HAVING``` clause).\n",
    "    - ```NumberOfPositiveItemLinesForProduct```: The total count of individual line items (product entries within an invoice) where the quantity was positive, for that specific customer and product.\n",
    "    - ```PercentageOfProductQuantity```: This shows how much this specific customer's ```TotalQuantityBoughtOfProduct``` contributes to the overall total quantity sold of that specific product (Description) across all customers in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**In essence, each row in the result tells you:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\"For this specific customer (from this country), who has bought this particular product more than once, here's the total quantity they bought of it, how many times they bought it, and what percentage of that product's overall sales they represent.\""
